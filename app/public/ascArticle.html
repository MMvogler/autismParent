                            This place is so entertaining! There’s a lot to do and it will keep 
                            my kid entertained for a whole hour or more, which is hard to do. 
                            They have a planetarium that my daughter is a little too young for, 
                            but they do a good job of having something for many age ranges. Once 
                            your kid is in middle school, they may not stay entertained, but all 
                            elementary school kids and younger will enjoy this place. <br> <br>

                            There’s a section in the middle for toddlers that’s really great! They 
                            can run around or sit and do a preplanned activity, depending on their 
                            speed. The best part about this place is that it is completely indoors, 
                            which is rare in Nashville. It is super rainy here most of the time and 
                            this Center has been a life saver many times when I have run out of ideas 
                            for indoor entertainment. <br> <br>

                            The only complaint that I’ve experienced and I know others have as well, 
                            is that there’s this amazing multistory maze in the middle of the building 
                            that can get a little tricky if you go by yourself with your kid. There are 
                            many opportunities to lose a child while they climb up a tube that takes 
                            them to the next story of the building, and trust me when I tell you that 
                            no adult is small enough to climb after them. <br> <br>         

                            There’s a panic that sets in for me when I realize that she is about to go 
                            to the third floor. I have to run around to the stairs and then frantically 
                            try to find her. Luckily there is only one entrance and exit to the facility 
                            with an employee watching the door. It is much easier to go with more than 
                            one adult. You gotta work defense in this place and doing it with another 
                            adult is always preferred! <br> <br>

                            Other than that it is a great way to entertain and educate your flock on a 
                            cold and/or rainy day!
