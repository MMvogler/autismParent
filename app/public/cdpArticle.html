                            This is really the best park for kids in Mount Juliet! The slides 
                            are huge and there is always a swing available for my daughter. 
                            There are two things that you should know in advance about this 
                            park, particularly if you have a child with ASD. First, they have 
                            a wonderful splash pad that is open in the Summer. However, they 
                            have a surprisingly strict rule that no children can run in the 
                            splash pad area. <br> <br>

                            Every kid in there gets so excited that they inevitably get caught 
                            up in the excitement and start to run. There is a teenager with a 
                            whistle that will tell your kid to stop. It’s a little sad seeing 
                            all the kids trying to temper their excitement, but I guess rules 
                            are rules. <br> <br>

                            Now I don’t know if your kid understands what’s happening when a 
                            person yells “STOP!” in their face, but my kid doesn’t understand or 
                            care and will continue to enjoy herself. I was the only parent who 
                            had to go into the water and hold their kid back. I didn’t realize I 
                            was going to have to do this. I was pretty soaked by the end of the 
                            experience, but luckily my phone and ego (from all the parents 
                            standing to the side staring at me) survived the incident and I never 
                            took her during the hours the splash pad was open (before 10am in the 
                            Summer last year). <br> <br>

                            Secondly, there is a section for the littlest kids that’s closed off, 
                            but if your child is a little older, they’ll go into the main play area. 
                            Know that the exits are wide open to the parking lot. It is easier to have 
                            more than one adult with you, so during the chaos and fun there’s someone 
                            to block most of the exits. You can definitely lose your kid if you’re not 
                            careful. I have heard this complaint not just from “Autism Parents” but 
                            also from parents with twins or just multiple high energy children. Come 
                            mentally prepared and/or in teams if you have 1 or more runners in your 
                            family. <br> <br>

                            It’s such a wonderful park, and who knows maybe they will find more 
                            lackadaisical employees to manage the splash pad this Summer. I can only 
                            hope!!
