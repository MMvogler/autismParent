                            I know that I usually write about places I go with Tamaryn, but this new 
                            transition we are going through has been something I’ve been dreading for 
                            a long time. I thought that others might be able to relate! <br> <br>           

                            I’ve tried to express to the best of my ability our daughter, Tamaryn’s, 
                            inability to stay still. The level of energy she has is unconscionable and 
                            makes many things a challenge. Like most kids with autism, she has a hard 
                            time sleeping. The challenges we have with getting her to sleep are ongoing, 
                            because they are ever-changing. It’s a mess… not in a cute ‘endearing’ way, 
                            but in a ‘cry in the corner, because we’re so tired and our patience has run 
                            out’ kind of way. <br> <br>

                            We are really lucky that she has never tried to get out of her crib before. 
                            She may be hyper, but at least she’s cautious and hyper. I am eternally 
                            grateful for this!! She just turned four recently and we still kept her in 
                            the crib… miraculously. It was getting a little cramped, my husband and I 
                            are both tall, so she’s a big kid, and her love of jumping up and down was 
                            wearing out the springs. <br> <br>

                            Well the bed finally broke one day right after she turned four. I was not 
                            looking forward to this moment, but it had finally arrived. The day we had 
                            to buy a bed. Not only was it a financial hit, but we also had to rack our 
                            brain for a plan that we could implement that might work. Luckily, she has 
                            ABA therapists that could advise us on this transition. <br> <br>

                            We bought a daybed so that only one side was open, and then we could put that 
                            open side against the wall if we needed to make it a little harder to get out. 
                            I had pretty low expectations on how this was going to turn out. I think the 
                            crucial thing we did was baby proof everything in the room to the best of our 
                            ability and then switch the doorknob around. That way we can lock it from the 
                            outside… without paying for a gate or something else that I’m sure I would have 
                            found annoyingly expensive. <br> <br>

                            We scheduled to have her in her new bed on a day when one of her ABA therapists 
                            could also join us. That way they could give us some feedback as to how this 
                            should work in real time during her first naptime. She has been in her new bed 
                            for a few days now. She definitely likes the change and that she now has a little 
                            bit more freedom to move throughout her room. Naps are a struggle, but if she 
                            doesn’t take her nap that just makes it easier to get her to fall asleep at night 
                            when she is insanely sleepy. <br> <br>

                            The things we are still trying to figure out are mainly based around her chewing 
                            and head hitting issues. I would love to just pad the whole damn room so she can 
                            never hurt herself, but that just gives her more things to rip apart and then chew 
                            in her room. Girl has a strong jaw! We are still working through this issue and 
                            taking it one day at a time. She is a tricky game, and the rules are constantly 
                            changing!
