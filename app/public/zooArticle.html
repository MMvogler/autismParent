                            The Nashville Zoo is hands down my daughter’s favorite place to go. I honestly don’t think 
                            that she notices the animals all that much. She sometimes giggles at the flamingos, but 
                            that’s about as much attention as she gives to the creatures around her. She is high energy, 
                            so I think she just likes the open space to run around. It is nice as a parent to take your 
                            child to a kid-friendly place where they can scream and run flat out without anyone batting 
                            an eye. This is definitely the best place for that in Nashville... weather permitting, of 
                            course. <br> <br> 
            
                            There’s a massive jungle gym area that I believe is closed as of right now while I’m writing 
                            this, but it will hopefully be updated and back open soon. There’s a padded area for the 
                            little ones to crawl and run around in as well as places to climb and swing for the older, 
                            elementary age, kids. <br> <br>
            
                            There’s a merry-go-round and a zip-line that cost extra to ride, and honestly, I could go on 
                            and on. This zoo is much larger than I think people really expect. My daughter zooms through 
                            it really quickly, so we are there for about an hour. If you are able to go slowly through 
                            the park, especially if you stop to get food at a vendor, then you might spend two or three 
                            hours there. One hour is about all my daughter can handle realistically.<br> <br>
            
                            They have a lot of events too at this zoo that have been really amazing. I personally think 
                            that their Halloween event is the best. I dread taking my child out for trick-or-treating 
                            every year and this event is something she actually enjoys. You can visit my Events page for 
                            more information.
