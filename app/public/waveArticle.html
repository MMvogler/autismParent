                        <p>
                            We went here last year and our daughter had so much fun! Due to the fact 
                            that it’s run by Nashville’s Parks and Rec department, it is super affordable, 
                            which is a huge plus when you’re taking your kid somewhere for the first time. 
                            It could be a total bust, but I felt like we could give it a try for the price.
                            <br> <br> 

                            There’s a café on site that sells burgers and hotdogs, which is convenient. You 
                            can also bring a cooler of whatever you want. I’m assuming alcohol is against 
                            the rules, but I’m honestly not sure at this place. It has got a pretty relaxed 
                            atmosphere! There’s a really nice kitty pool, a big wave pool with plenty of 
                            free inner tubes, and a few large water slides for the bigger kids. It was clean 
                            and just what we needed for a day outside in water!  <br> <br> 
                            
                            We did have to wait in a line to get in, which is always a struggle for my 
                            daughter. Even though we got there right when it opened. That’s always my trick 
                            to avoid lines anywhere I go, but that won’t work here. I believe that we could 
                            have rented a locker to keep our stuff in, and they did have picnic tables. There 
                            are some shady places, but everything is outside.  <br> <br> 
                            
                            The biggest thing to prepare for if you have a child with sensory issues is the 
                            crowd. It can get pretty crowded at any point in the Summer, so if your kid has a 
                            hard time with a crowded and loud space, this might be a little stressful. Our 
                            daughter loves water so much that it was easy to push past that anxiety and adjust 
                            to the waves. She had a blast and we would definitely do it again!  <br> <br>
